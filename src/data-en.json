After that in 1827, the building was bought from the monastery to become the new Town Hall. During all this time fires were a common threat in Holzkirchen and eventually the building burned down in 1842. Afterwards it was rebuilt bigger than it had previously had been. Along with Holzkirchens growth, the town hall had to grow as well so in 1896 the boardroom was enlarged. In 1913 a new chandelier was put into the community hall.

Some scientists assume that in the course of the “Würm glacial stage”, the last glacial period in the Alpine foothills, huge glaciers were pushed into the Alpine foothills which made the formation of the Teufelsgraben possible. You can find multiple remains of this time in the Bavarian Alpine foothills. The  “Ammersee”, the “Starnbergersee” and the typical Moraine landscape are such remains raised through bigger glaciers which came from the Alps about 2000 years ago. The water melting from the glaciers created rifts like the “Mühltal” (at Starnberg), the  “Gleißenthal” (south of Munich, from “Deiniger Weiher” to “Deisenhofen”) and our  “Teufelsgraben”."

He looked at the city with fury and hatred because the people of Munich were too Christian for him. Due to their many devotions he could not find a place among them. Then he thought of locking away their water out of revenge and leading the “Isar” to the lake “Chiemsee”. He quickly got to work and started digging at night as if he had got a thousand hands. As he was in full swing, someone appeared. It was the sacristan from “Föching”, who - in order not to oversleep the ringing of prayer - had already gotten up at midnight. When he heard the noise and saw all the beating and shoveling, digging and throwing, and how the earth flew off to the right and left, he asked: \"What are you doing?\" - The devil growled: \"If I want to divert the Isar here, what does that concern you?\" - \"One might think so,\" replied the sacristan, \"Do you want to get it done by today? It will take you quite a few years!\" - \"How about a bet for your soul?\", replied the devil, \"Before the morning bell rings, I'm done digging.\" - \"I'm in\" replied the church attendant, \"even if I can't win anything\". But soon he was horrified by the eerie unknown, set the church clock two hours ahead and rang the prayer bell at 3 o'clock. All the cocks immediately came alive and broke the magic of the night with their crows. But the devil, angry that he had miscalculated his actions, threw away the pimple and shovel, gave up his work and went to hell.“"

The devil had to build a channel from the Isar to his mill for which the miller promised his soul. The next night before the first cockcrow, the devil had to complete the moat and started to work in the darkness with great force. The tremendous pit already reached from “Stumbach” to “Otterfing” and from “Holzkirchen” to “Valley” which fulfilled the miller with great fear and regret. He quickly ran home to the chicken shed and woke up the cock. The cock crowed brightly through the whole neighborhood - and so the miller’s pact with the devil was dissolved."
